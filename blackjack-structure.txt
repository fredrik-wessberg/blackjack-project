		and must stop 17 or over

Comments:
	Shuffle cards one time during execution.
	User chooses amount of decks (6-8)



Functions:

Pre-game functionality:
	deckofcards() -> Done
	
	shuffledeck() -> Partly completed:
					 shuffling with newDeck.push(_.shuffle(baseDeck));
		
	
	drawCard() -> Both dealer and user uses this function. My suggestion is that we can, out of the x arrays created, pick a card with a randomized number since the decks we've created are shuffled "on top of eachother".
	
	userhand() -> display value. Make decisions based on rules -> in-game functionality
	
	dealerAI() -> display card. Make decisions based on rules -> in-game functionality

In-game functionality:
	placebets()
	credit()
	splitcards()
	double()
	card_value() -> needs further explaination, can't recall specifics.

Objects:
	dealer
	user
